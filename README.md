## 📖 Introduction
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code. This repository includes practical examples and projects that demonstrate various Assembly language concepts.

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Before using this repository, you should have:
- 📚 Basic understanding of Assembly language
- 🛠 An assembler like NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- 🖥 A compatible emulator or debugger such as DOSBox or gdb

## 💻 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedkhamees37/Assembly-Language.git
   cd Assembly-Language
   ```
2. Install NASM (if not installed):
   - On Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install nasm
     ```
   - On Windows:
     Download and install NASM from [nasm.us](https://www.nasm.us/).
3. Compile an Assembly file:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 filename.asm -o filename.o
   ld filename.o -o filename
   ./filename
   ```

## 📂 Projects Overview
The repository contains different Assembly programs, including:
- **📢 Basic I/O Operations** - Programs that demonstrate user input and output handling.
- **➕ Arithmetic Operations** - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in Assembly.
- **🔤 String Manipulation** - Working with strings in Assembly.
- **🖥 System Calls** - Demonstrating how to interact with the operating system.

## ⚙️ Usage
- 📂 Navigate to the specific project folder.
- ✍️ Open the `.asm` file in an editor.
- 🔨 Compile and run the program using NASM and an appropriate linker.
- 🛠 Modify and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding.
